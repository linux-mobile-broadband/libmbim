Overview of changes in libmbim 1.30
----------------------------------------

 * Build:
   ** Flag types are now generated in their own 'mbim-flag-types.[c|h]' files.
   ** A new 'enable_fuzzer' option is available to build LLVM LibFuzzer
      based unit testers.

 * New Intel Mutual Authentication service, including the following operations:
   * MBIM_CID_INTEL_MUTUAL_AUTHENTICATION_FCC_LOCK

 * New Intel Tools service, including the following operations:
   * MBIM_CID_INTEL_TOOLS_TRACE_CONFIG

 * New Google service, including the following operations:
   * MBIM_CID_GOOGLE_CARRIER_LOCK

 * Extended the Microsoft-defined Basic Connect Extensions service, including
   the following operations:
   * MBIM_CID_MS_BASIC_CONNECT_EXTENSIONS_DEVICE_RESET

 * libmbim-glib:
   ** mbim_message_validate() is updated to ensure that the given message is
      complete and not a partial fragment.
   ** mbim_device_command_finish() is updated to ensure that the returned
      message is complete and not a partial fragment.
   ** Updated string reading logic to perform a UTF-8 validity check explicitly
      when converting from UTF-16.
   ** The message and field parsing logic is updated to ensure unaligned values
      can be read, given that the new MBIM extensions no longer ensure field
      alignment.
   ** Additional field validations have been added when parsing TLVs, fragment
      headers and string/struct arrays.
   ** Fixed reading 'ms-struct-array' items that may have struct elements with
      variable size.
   ** Added new 'NONE' values in MbimCellularClass, MbimSimClass, MbimDataClass,
      MbimSmsCaps and MbimDataClassV3, so that all flag types have one to
      indicate an empty bitmask.
   ** New MbimTraceCommand enum, used in the Intel Tools service.
   ** New MbimCarrierLockStatus, MbimCarrierLockModemState and
      MbimCarrierLockCause enums, used in the Google service.
   ** Extended the list of MbimStatusError values with new errors reported by
      the operations in the Google service.
   ** The MbimSmsStatusFlag type is now defined as flags, not as enum.

 * mbimcli:
   ** New '--ms-device-reset' action.

   ** New generic '--printable' action to decode MBIM messages.

 * mbim-proxy:
   ** New '--verbose-full' option to request enabling logs that include personal
      information.

 * Several other improvements and fixes.

 * All fixes and improvements that were backported to 1.28.x releases are also
   present in libmbim 1.30.0.


Overview of changes in libmbim 1.28
----------------------------------------

 * There is no longer an upstream-provided source tarball, please use the signed
   git tag '1.28.0' instead to refer to the sources of this release.

 * License boilerplate in the sources has been changed by SPDX identifiers.

 * This version includes support for most operations in MBIM Extensions v2 (for
   5G NSA) and v3 (for 5G SA). The enabling of the updated extensions requires
   the user of the library to explicitly request what version wants to be used,
   via the new 'MBIM_DEVICE_OPEN_FLAGS_MS_MBIMEX_V2' or
   'MBIM_DEVICE_OPEN_FLAGS_MS_MBIMEX_V3' flags in the device open request.
   Please note that if one process enables the v2 or v3 support, it will apply
   to operations done by other processes as well. When using the proxy, the
   current version support is propagated to all clients of the proxy
   automatically.

 * The verbose message logging will now by default hide all fields that are
   considered personal information. Extended message logging including all
   field contents should be explicitly requested.

 * Build:
   ** The GNU autotools (autoconf/automake/libtool) support has been fully
      removed, this release requires the use of the meson build system.
   ** The 'instrospection' meson option is now a boolean.
   ** New boolean 'man' meson option to allow disabling the man page generation.

 * Extended the Basic Connect service, including the following operations:
   * MBIM_CID_BASIC_CONNECT_REGISTER_STATE (MBIMEx v2.0)

   ** New MbimTlv type to support the variable-sized fields in MBIMEx v3.0
      operations.
   ** Ensure CLOSED state always in mbim_device_close(), even on error.
   ** Disallow device close if an open operation is ongoing.
   ** Extended MbimDataClass with 5G NSA/SA values, used in MBIMEx v2.0, and
      added new MbimDataClassV3 and MbimDataSubclass types, used in MBIMEX v3.0.
   ** Extended MbimCtrlCaps and MbimSubscriberReadyState with values reported
      in MBIMEX v3.0 extensions.
   ** New MbimWakeType, MbimAccessMediaType, MbimModemConfigurationStatus,

 * Several other improvements and fixes.

The following features which were backported to 1.26.x releases are also present
in libmbim 1.28.0:

 * mbim-codegen: explicitly require python3.
 * compat: deprecate the MbimLteAttachStatus type.
 * libmbim-glib: added support for a new Quectel service.
 * mbimcli: new '--quectel-query-radio-state' and '--quectel-set-radio-state'
   operations, which provide a way to FCC unlock EM120 modules in new Lenovo
   laptops.


Overview of changes in libmbim 1.26
----------------------------------------

 * Build now requires GLib/GObject/GIO 2.56.

 * The GUdev optional build/runtime requirement is now fully dropped, it's no
   longer used.

 * Building from git no longer requires autoconf-archive, the needed AX_ macros
   are now shipped inside m4/.

 * In addition to building from a source release tarball, or building from git
   checkouts using the GNU autotools suite (autoconf/automake/libtool), this
   release includes the initial support for the meson build system. The meson
   port is not fully complete yet, as there are some missing things in the doc
   generation steps, but for system integration or development purposes, the
   port should be fully operational. This major release, including all its
   stable updates in the 1.26.x series, will be the last ones providing support
   for GNU autotools. The next major release will likely be a meson-only one,
   and will therefore not be based on a source release tarball any more, but
   on specific git tags instead.

 * Implemented new link management operations, exclusively for the cdc_mbim
   driver for now. These new operations allow creating or deleting VLAN network
   interfaces in order to run multiplexed data sessions over one single physical
   network interface.

 * Added support for the Microsoft-defined SAR service, including the following
   operations:
   ** MBIM_CID_MS_SAR_CONFIG
   ** MBIM_CID_MS_SAR_TRANSMISSION_STATUS

 * Added support for the Microsoft-defined UICC Low Level Access service,
   including the following operations:
   ** MBIM_CID_MS_UICC_LOW_LEVEL_ACCESS_ATR
   ** MBIM_CID_MS_UICC_LOW_LEVEL_ACCESS_OPEN_CHANNEL
   ** MBIM_CID_MS_UICC_LOW_LEVEL_ACCESS_CLOSE_CHANNEL
   ** MBIM_CID_MS_UICC_LOW_LEVEL_ACCESS_APDU
   ** MBIM_CID_MS_UICC_LOW_LEVEL_ACCESS_TERMINAL_CAPABILITY
   ** MBIM_CID_MS_UICC_LOW_LEVEL_ACCESS_RESET

 * Added support for the Qualcomm-defined QDU service, including the following
   operations:
   ** MBIM_CID_QDU_UPDATE_SESSION
   ** MBIM_CID_QDU_FILE_OPEN
   ** MBIM_CID_QDU_FILE_WRITE

 * Extended the Microsoft-defined Basic Connect Extensions service, including
   the following operations:
   ** MBIM_CID_MS_BASIC_CONNECT_EXTENSIONS_DEVICE_CAPS
   ** MBIM_CID_MS_BASIC_CONNECT_EXTENSIONS_SYS_CAPS
   ** MBIM_CID_MS_BASIC_CONNECT_EXTENSIONS_SLOT_INFO_STATUS
   ** MBIM_CID_MS_BASIC_CONNECT_EXTENSIONS_DEVICE_SLOT_MAPPINGS

 * libmbim-glib:
   ** Logic updated to make sure full packets are written at once, instead of
      writing them in chunks.
   ** Updated the "LTE attach status" APIs in order to avoid creating unneeded
      struct types in the interface. The older methods have been deprecated and
      maintained in the library for compatibility purposes only.

 * mbim-proxy:
   ** Internal buffer size updated from 512 bytes to 4096 bytes.

 * mbimcli:
   ** New '--ms-set-sar-config' and '--ms-query-sar-config' actions.
   ** New '--ms-set-transmission-status' and '--ms-query-transmission-status'
      actions.
   ** Updated '--enter-pin', '--disable-pin' and '--unlock-pin' to allow other
      PIN types, not just assuming PIN1.
   ** New '--link-add', '--link-delete', '--link-list' and '--link-delete-all'
      actions.
   ** New '--ms-query-sys-caps' action.
   ** New '--ms-query-slot-info-status' action.
   ** New '--ms-query-device-slot-mappings' and '--ms-set-device-slot-mappings'
      actions.
   ** Renamed '--ms-query-lte-attach-status' to '--ms-query-lte-attach-info',
      and kept the old name for compatibility purposes.

 * mbim-network:
   ** When using the mbim-proxy, skip trying to manage the MBIM session and
      transaction ids as that is implicitly done by the proxy already.

 * Several other minor improvements and fixes.

The following features which were backported to 1.24.x releases are also present
in libmbim 1.26.0:

 * Fixed merged subscribe list reporting and handling in the proxy.
 * Fixed transaction id handling when multiple fragments are involved.
 * Fixed read overflows on malformed messages.
 * Skip warnings if descriptors file cannot be read, as in new MBIM backends
   other than cdc_mbim.


Overview of changes in libmbim 1.24
----------------------------------------

 * Build now requires GLib/GObject/GIO 2.48.

 * Added new GObject Introspection support in the library, that can be
   explicitly requested during configure with --enable-introspection=yes.
   With the new introspection support, the libmbim-glib library can now be
   used directly from e.g. python programs, as in the example included with
   the release.

 * Added release version information to all the types and methods of the public
   library API, and added new per-version indices in the documentation.

 * Added g_autoptr() support to all public types.

 * Several other minor improvements and fixes.

Overview of changes in libmbim 1.22
----------------------------------------

 * Build updated with several improvements:
   ** The build has been updated to use by default all warnings enabled by
      AX_COMPILER_FLAGS(), and therefore when building the release from a git
      checkout, autoconf-archive >= 2017.03.21 is now required. This new build
      dependency isn't required when building from the release tarball.
   ** Also when building from a git checkout, beware because by default
      --enable-compile-warnings=error is enabled, which implies -Werror. If
      you'd like to build from git and avoid -Werror, you should explicitly use
      --enable-compile-warnings=yes (to keep the warnings but without being
      errors), --enable-compile-warnings=no (to disable all the extra warnings
      enabled by default) or --disable-Werror (to unconditionally make all
      compiler warnings non-fatal).

 * libmbim-glib:
   ** Message parsing logic improved to avoid reading fields out of bounds, e.g.
      if the messages sent by the modem are malformed or not in line with the
      specs.

 * Several other minor improvements and fixes.

The following features which were backported to 1.20.x releases are also present
in libmbim 1.22.0:

 * libmbim-glib: fixed handling of fragmented indication messages.
 * mbimcli: added --query-provisioned-contexts.
 * mbim-proxy: fix logic when symlinks to cdc-wdm ports are used.


Overview of changes in libmbim 1.20
----------------------------------------

 * Build updated with several fixes:
   ** Explicitly define max allowed GLib version.
   ** Fix issues with -Werror=type-limits.
   ** Made compiler warning options compatible with clang.

 * mbim-proxy:
   ** Fixed client subscription to service indications using wildcard.
   ** Fixed client subscription update logic when services/cids are being
      removed.
   ** New '--empty-timeout=[SECS}' option to specify the empty lifetime
      duration.
   ** New '--no-exit' option to avoid the proxy from exiting.

 * Several other minor improvements and fixes.

The following features which were backported to 1.18.x releases are also present
in libmbim 1.20.0:

 * mbim-proxy: default empty lifetime set to 300s.

Overview of changes in libmbim 1.18
----------------------------------------

 * Build now looks for the correct python provider in the system during
   configure.

 * New Microsoft Basic Connect Extensions service, that includes new commands to
   manage Protocol Configuration Operations (PCO) as well as LTE attach status
   and settings.

 * libmbim-glib:
   ** Added support to fully print all message contents, including all fields,
      when traces are enabled.
   ** Added support for QMI indications over MBIM.
   ** Added additional cause codes to MbimNwError.
   ** Fixed signal emission in device, so that it's done before completing
      transaction task.

 * mbim-proxy:
   ** Fixed the management of subscribed events, so that the lists are
      maintained per-device.

 * mbimcli:
   ** New '--ms-query-pco' action.
   ** New '--ms-query-lte-attach-configuration' action.
   ** New '--ms-query-lte-attach-status' action.

 * Several other minor improvements and fixes.

The following features which were backported to 1.16.x releases are also present
in libmbim 1.18.0:

 * mbimcli:
   ** Fix SNR reporting in --atds-query-signal output.
   ** Longer timeout (60s) in --disconnect.
   ** Add "ip-type" property to --connect

 * libmbim-glib:
   ** Fix printing message in Intel Firmware Update service.
   ** Fix error reporting when unknown status.

Overview of changes in libmbim 1.16
----------------------------------------

* Build now requires GLib 2.36.

* All the code base was ported to use the GTask based asynchronous operations
  support instead of the deprecated GSimpleAsyncResult.

* New AT&T Device Service support, that includes operator-specific commands to
  query signal info or cell location.

* New Intel Firmware Update Service support, that includes commands to request
  the Intel-based module to reboot in firmware download mode.

* libmbim-glib:
  ** Added MBIM_STATUS_ERROR_CONTEXT_NOT_SUPPORTED to MbimStatusError.
  ** Avoid using iconv() directly for the UTF-16BE conversions, which makes it
     possible to use libmbim on systems with a stub iconv() implementation.
  ** Added support to detect already open MBIM channels on the Sierra Wireless
     EM7345.

* mbimcli:
  ** New '--query-ip-packet-filters' action.
  ** New '--query-pin-list' action.
  ** New '--atds-query-signal' and '--atds-query-location' actions.
  ** New '--intel-modem-reboot' action.

* Several other minor improvements and fixes.

The following features which were backported to 1.14.x releases are also present
in libmbim 1.16.0:

* libmbim-glib:
  ** Prefer realpath() to canonicalize_file_name().
  ** Added MBIM_READY_INFO_FLAG_NONE to MbimReadyInfoFlag.

* mbim-proxy:
  ** Avoid receiving signals from the parent process.

* mbimcli:
  ** Add cancellability to the query-ip-configuration action.

Overview of changes in libmbim 1.14
----------------------------------------

* New support for the 'QMI over MBIM' service, so that clients can use libqmi to
  build messages and libmbim to transport them.

* The GUDev library, which we use to read the max message size from the USB
  descriptor, is now optional. When configuring, it will be used by default only
  if it's found. It can also be explicitly disabled using the new configure
  switch '--without-udev' or explicitly enabled using '--with-udev'. If GUDev
  isn't used, libmbim-glib will rely on sysfs directly.

* libmbim-glib updates:
  ** Added support for building messages of custom services.

* mbim-network updates:
  ** Added support for loading profiles from different paths using the new
     '--profile' option. This makes it possible to use mbim-network with
     multiple devices running in the same system.
  ** Added support to allow specifying APN user (APN_USER), password (APN_PASS)
     and authentication type (APN_AUTH) in the profile.
  ** Added support to allow using the mbim-proxy setup by configuring it in
     the profile file (PROXY=yes).

* Several other minor improvements and fixes.

The following features which were backported to 1.12.x releases are also present
in libmbim 1.14.0:

 * mbimcli updates:
   ** Updated '--connect' arguments to allow specifying "key=value" pairs. The
      old legacy "[(APN),(PAP|CHAP|MSCHAPV2),(Username),(Password)]" format is
      kept as valid for backwards compatibility, although it should be assumed
      deprecated.
   ** Longer timeouts for connect/register operations.
   ** Report IP configuration when connected.
   ** Allow specifying session ids.

 * libmbim-glib updates:
   ** Probing retry interval increased to 5s.

Overview of changes in libmbim 1.12
----------------------------------------

* New `--enable-mbim-username' option during configure, which allows specifying
  which will be the user owning the /dev/cdc-wdm character devices of all MBIM
  modems (udev rules are installed to change file ownership). If this option is
  used, the mbim-proxy will only allow connections from processes running by the
  specified user or by the root user.

* Function error messages can now be returned by the MbimDevice as responses to
  `Command', `Open' or `Close' messages. Users of the library should not assume
  the type of message returned to the previous actions.

* The MbimProxy will monitor for 'NotOpened' errors, and when one detected it
  will directly close the internal MbimDevice. Any subsequent request sent by
  clients to that specific device will be aborted with a proxy-generated
  'NotOpened' error. Clients will need to explicitly reopen the ports in that
  case.

* The API now has a new mbim_message_response_get_result() method which allows
  getting a GError from a message which may be of a specific type (e.g. a
  `Command Done' message in response to a `Command' request) or instead the
  generic `Function Error' message type. Users of the library can use this new
  method to avoid assuming the type of message returned.

      E.g. the following check:
          mbim_message_command_done_get_result (response, &error);
      Can be updated as:
          mbim_message_response_get_result (response,
                                            MBIM_MESSAGE_TYPE_COMMAND_DONE,
                                            &error);
      And the same logic can be applied to `Open' and `Close' messages.

* Other bugfixes and minor improvements:
  ** Attach timeout and idle events to the thread-default context.
  ** Fix bashisms in the mbim-network script.


Overview of changes in libmbim 1.10
----------------------------------------

 * API break: Flag values in 'MbimRegistrationFlag' were updated to match the
   ones in the MBIM documentation.

 * Implemented a new 'mbim-proxy', which allows sharing a single MBIM control
   port among different processes. The usage of the proxy is optional, and can
   be requested by specifying the MBIM_DEVICE_OPEN_FLAGS_PROXY flag in the new
   mbim_device_open_full() method. The 'mbimcli' command line tool was also
   extended with a new '--device-open-proxy,-p' option, to allow requesting the
